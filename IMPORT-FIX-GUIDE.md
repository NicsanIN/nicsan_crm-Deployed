# 🔧 Import Fix Guide

## ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**

The cross-device sync service was using **incorrect import syntax**:
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - Named import
import { NicsanCRMService } from './api-integration';

// ✅ Correct - Default import  
import NicsanCRMService from './api-integration';
```

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED:**

### **1. Fixed Import Statement:**
- Changed from named import to default import
- Added cache-busting comment to force browser refresh

### **2. Added Debug Logging:**
- Added console logs to verify method availability
- This will help identify if methods exist on the service

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS:**

### **1. Clear Browser Cache:**
- **Hard refresh** the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Or open **Developer Tools** → **Application** → **Storage** → **Clear storage**

### **2. Restart Dev Server:**
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### **3. Check Console Output:**
You should now see:
```
🔍 Debug: NicsanCRMService methods: {
  getPolicies: "function",
  getUploads: "function", 
  getDashboardMetrics: "function"
}
```

---

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If Still Getting Errors:**

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for the debug output showing method types
   - If methods show as "undefined", there's still an import issue

2. **Verify File Changes:**
   - Make sure the crossDeviceSyncService.ts file has the correct import
   - Check that the file was saved properly

3. **Module Resolution:**
   - The api-integration.ts exports as default: `export default NicsanCRMService.getInstance()`
   - So we need default import: `import NicsanCRMService from './api-integration'`

---

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS:**

After the fix, you should see:
- ✅ No more "getPolicies is not a function" errors
- ✅ Debug logs showing all methods as "function"
- ✅ Cross-device sync working properly
- ✅ WebSocket connection established

**The import issue should now be resolved!** 🚀✨
