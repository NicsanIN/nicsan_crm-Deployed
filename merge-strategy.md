# 🔄 Nicsan CRM: Two-Way Merge Strategy

## Current Situation
- **Production (main)**: Has frontend corrections you want to keep
- **Staging**: Has new features you want to keep
- **Goal**: Create unified codebase with both

## Step-by-Step Merge Plan

### Phase 1: Backup & Preparation
1. ✅ Create `unified-frontend` branch
2. 🔄 Backup current state
3. 📋 Document what changes we want to keep from each branch

### Phase 2: Merge Production Corrections
1. 🔍 Identify specific frontend corrections in main branch
2. 📝 List the corrections we want to preserve
3. 🔄 Apply these corrections to staging structure

### Phase 3: Preserve Staging Features
1. ✅ Keep all new modular components
2. ✅ Keep password management features
3. ✅ Keep user management features
4. ✅ Keep business settings

### Phase 4: Resolve Conflicts
1. 🔍 Identify any conflicting changes
2. 🔧 Manually resolve conflicts
3. ✅ Test each resolution

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
1. 🧪 Test unified codebase
2. 🚀 Update both production and staging
3. 📋 Document the unified structure

## Key Files to Merge

### Frontend Components (from staging)
- `src/pages/founders/` - All new founder pages
- `src/pages/operations/` - All new operations pages
- `src/components/` - New component library
- `src/services/` - New API services

### Potential Conflicts
- `src/NicsanCRMMock.tsx` - Main app file (staging has modular version)
- `src/services/api.ts` - API service differences
- Component implementations that exist in both branches

## Next Steps
1. Identify specific frontend corrections from main
2. Apply them to staging's modular structure
3. Test the unified result
4. Deploy to both environments
