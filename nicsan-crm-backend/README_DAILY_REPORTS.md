## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`routes/reports.js`** - API endpoints for report generation
2. **`services/emailService.js`** - Enhanced with daily report email functionality
3. **`jobs/dailyReport.js`** - Scheduled job for automatic report generation
4. **`server.js`** - Added reports route and scheduler initialization
5. **`package.json`** - Added `node-cron` dependency

### Database Queries

The system uses optimized SQL queries:

```sql
-- Main report query
SELECT 
  COALESCE(branch, 'Unknown') as branch,
  COALESCE(vehicle_type, 'Unknown') as vehicle_type,
  COALESCE(rollover, 'Unknown') as rollover_status,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_od, 0)) as total_od_amount
FROM policies 
WHERE DATE(created_at) = $1
GROUP BY branch, vehicle_type, rollover
ORDER BY branch, vehicle_type, rollover_status;

-- Summary query
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_policies,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_od, 0)) as total_od,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rollover = 'Rollover' THEN 1 END) as rollover_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rollover = 'Renewal' THEN 1 END) as renewal_count
FROM policies 
WHERE DATE(created_at) = $1;
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test report generation
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/reports/daily-od-report?date=2024-01-15" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Test email sending
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/reports/send-daily-od-report" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date":"2024-01-15"}'
```

### Development Mode
In development mode, the scheduler runs every hour for testing (commented out by default).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No emails received**
   - Check `FOUNDER_EMAIL_1` and `FOUNDER_EMAIL_2` environment variables
   - Verify SMTP configuration
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Empty reports**
   - Verify policies exist for the date
   - Check `branch`, `vehicle_type`, `rollover` fields are populated
   - Ensure `total_od` values are not null

3. **Scheduler not running**
   - Check server startup logs
   - Verify `node-cron` dependency is installed
   - Check timezone configuration

### Logs

The system provides detailed logging:
```
üìä Generating daily OD report...
üìß Sending daily OD report email...
‚úÖ Daily OD report sent successfully
üì¨ Recipients: founder1@company.com, founder2@company.com
üìß Message ID: <message-id>
```
