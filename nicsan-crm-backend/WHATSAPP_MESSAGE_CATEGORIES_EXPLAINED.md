## 🔧 How WhatsApp Determines Category

When you create a template in WhatsApp Business Manager, you **manually select** the category. WhatsApp will:
1. Review your template content
2. Verify it matches the selected category
3. Approve or reject based on category rules

**For policy notifications:**
- WhatsApp expects **UTILITY** category
- If you select **MARKETING**, it will be approved but won't deliver without opt-in

---

## 📱 Impact on Your Messages

### **Current Situation (MARKETING):**

```
Your Template: "policy"
Category: MARKETING ❌
Status: APPROVED ✅
Delivery: BLOCKED ❌ (no opt-in)

Result: API accepts message → WhatsApp blocks delivery → Customer doesn't receive
```

### **After Fix (UTILITY):**

```
Your Template: "policy"
Category: UTILITY ✅
Status: APPROVED ✅
Delivery: ALLOWED ✅ (no opt-in needed)

Result: API accepts message → WhatsApp delivers → Customer receives ✅
```
