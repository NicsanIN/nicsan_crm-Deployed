# Branch-Specific Daily Reports Configuration

## Overview
The system now supports both founder-level overall reports AND branch-specific reports for individual branch heads. This provides comprehensive reporting at both executive and operational levels.

## Report Types

### 1. Founder Reports (Overall)
- **Recipients:** Founders (FOUNDER_EMAIL_1, FOUNDER_EMAIL_2)
- **Content:** Company-wide data from all branches
- **Purpose:** Executive overview and strategic decision making

### 2. Branch Reports (Individual)
- **Recipients:** Individual branch heads
- **Content:** Branch-specific data only
- **Purpose:** Operational management and branch performance tracking

## Environment Variables Required

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Founder Emails (Overall Reports) - EXISTING
FOUNDER_EMAIL_1=founder1@company.com
FOUNDER_EMAIL_2=founder2@company.com

# Branch Head Emails (Branch-Specific Reports) - NEW
MYSORE_BRANCH_HEAD_EMAIL=mysore.head@company.com
BANASHANKARI_BRANCH_HEAD_EMAIL=banashankari.head@company.com
ADUGODI_BRANCH_HEAD_EMAIL=adugodi.head@company.com

# Email Configuration (EXISTING)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Report Schedule

**Daily at 9:00 AM IST:**
1. **Overall Report** â†’ Sent to Founders (company-wide data)
2. **Mumbai Report** â†’ Sent to Mumbai Branch Head (Mumbai data only)
3. **Delhi Report** â†’ Sent to Delhi Branch Head (Delhi data only)
4. **Bangalore Report** â†’ Sent to Bangalore Branch Head (Bangalore data only)

## Report Content Differences

### Founder Report (Overall)
```
ðŸ“Š Daily Total OD Report - Company Overview
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“ˆ Company Summary (All Branches Combined)
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š Branch Performance Comparison
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š Vehicle Type Analysis (Company-wide)
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š Daily Breakdown (All Branches)
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“ˆ Monthly Breakdown (All Branches)
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary
```

### Branch Report (Example: Mumbai)
```
ðŸ“Š Daily Total OD Report - MYSORE Branch
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“ˆ MYSORE Branch Summary Only
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š MYSORE Vehicle Types Only
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š MYSORE Rollover/Renewal Only
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š MYSORE Daily Breakdown
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“ˆ MYSORE Monthly Breakdown
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‹ MYSORE Performance Metrics
```

## Database Requirements

The system uses the existing `branch` field in the `policies` table:
- **MYSORE:** Policies with `branch = 'MYSORE'`
- **BANASHANKARI:** Policies with `branch = 'BANASHANKARI'`
- **ADUGODI:** Policies with `branch = 'ADUGODI'`

## Implementation Features

### 1. Dual Report System
- **Founder Reports:** Continue exactly as before (no changes)
- **Branch Reports:** New functionality added alongside

### 2. Branch-Specific Data Filtering
- Each branch report only includes data for that specific branch
- Vehicle type breakdowns are branch-specific
- Rollover/Renewal analysis is branch-specific
- Daily and monthly trends are branch-specific

### 3. Email Templates
- **Founder Template:** Company-wide branding and comprehensive data
- **Branch Template:** Branch-specific branding and focused data
- Both templates include HTML and text versions

### 4. Error Handling
- If no email is configured for a branch head, that branch report is skipped
- If no data exists for a branch, that branch report is skipped
- Founder reports continue regardless of branch report status

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the complete dual report system
cd nicsan-crm-backend
node -e "
const dailyReportScheduler = require('./jobs/dailyReport');
dailyReportScheduler.testDailyReport();
"
```

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure all environment variables are set
2. Verify database connection
3. Confirm email configuration
4. Test with sample data

## Benefits

### For Founders

### For Branch Heads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Branch reports not sending:**
