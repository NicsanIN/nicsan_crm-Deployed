# Email Integration Complete - Step 2

## ‚úÖ **Step 2: Integrate with Policy Confirmation - COMPLETED**

The email service has been successfully integrated with the policy confirmation flow in `routes/upload.js`.

### üîß **What's Been Updated:**

#### **1. Email Service Import**
```javascript
const emailService = require('../services/emailService');
```

#### **2. Email Integration in Policy Confirmation**
The policy confirmation route (`POST /:uploadId/confirm`) now includes:

```javascript
// NEW: Send PDF via email to customer
try {
  const customerEmail = policyData.customer_email || policyData.customerEmail;
  if (customerEmail) {
    console.log('üìß Sending policy PDF to customer:', customerEmail);
    
    const emailResult = await emailService.sendPolicyPDF(
      customerEmail,
      policyData,
      upload.s3_key,  // Original PDF S3 key
      upload.filename  // Original PDF filename
    );
    
    if (emailResult.success) {
      console.log('‚úÖ PDF sent to customer successfully:', emailResult.messageId);
    } else {
      console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è Email sending failed:', emailResult.error);
      // Don't fail policy creation if email fails
    }
  } else {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è No customer email found, skipping email sending');
  }
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è Email service error:', emailError.message);
  // Don't fail policy creation if email fails
}
```
